### [Artsy Mobile team issue tracker.](https://github.com/artsy/mobile/issues)

Artsy Mobile is @ashfurrow, @1aurabrown and @orta. We get some help occasionally from @dblock. If you're interested in joining, [look here](https://artsy.net/job/mobile-engineer).

We revolve around three apps. [Eigen](http://iphone.artsy.net) is the iOS app for the general public. [Energy](http://orta.io/#folio-header-unit) a portfolio app for gallery partners and [Eidolon](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/) an open-source Auctions bidding app.

This repo is for keeping track of issues around the team, and telling people to do stuff etc. Open because [Open by Default](http://code.dblock.org/open-source-is-simply-part-of-my-teams-job-description). Feel free to post issues about and around the artsy mobile team here.
